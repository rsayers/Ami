Ami - A small web framework in Scheme.


Ami is written first and foremost as my capstone project  for my bachelors 
degree.  It is however being written to future use in mind to fit the needs of 
a recent schemer and long time web developer.

Ami is Japanese for Web, and French for Friend.  I hope that it lives up to 
this name and ends up being a friendly little framework.  It is inspired by 
Sinatra.rb and Web.py.

What you currently hold is the first alpha release.  It has most features you 
will need for writing a webapp but is of course under development so more 
features and stability will be added int he future.

An example:

(require "ami.scm")
(get "/hi" (lambda () "Hello from Ami!"))
(run)
